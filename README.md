The data and codes here are for review purpose only. Any other use of the files in this repository must be approved by the   authors and the request should be sent to the corresponding author at vzorba@lbl.gov. If there is any question regarding the details of the coding, the reques can also be sent to: boyu.zhang@lbl.gov.
The simulation codes here are for modified PSD only (VortexTurbulence_loopversion_modified.m for the relationship of the circularity versus turbulence strength, and VortexTurbulence_loopversion_scalelength_modified.m for the relationship of the circularity versus inner scales), while for other PSDs, it involves simply a replacement of the mathematical expression of the PSD in the codes.
Other codes are for the plot of the figures in the main text, including the comparison between experimental and simulation results and the comparison among different PSDs.
The mat file containing the simulation results and experimental results are also attached here. However, these mat file only contain the mean and standard deviations of the samples. The simulation results can be directly generated from the codes here, and the raw data is available upon proper requirement sent to the corresponding author at vzorba@lbl.gov.
